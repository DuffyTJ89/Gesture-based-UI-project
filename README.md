# MyoArmband Snake

The aim of this project was to develop an application with a Natural User Interface. We chose to implement Myo armband controles on the classsic mobile game Snake.

# Technologies used
  - Unity
  - Myo Armband
  - Visual Studio

# Why Snake?

With Snake being so well known (everyone above a certain age has played it) we thought this would be a good opportunity to give a different take on the classic game by adding in physical gesture controles.
